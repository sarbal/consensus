# Is it time to change the reference genome? 
The use of the human reference genome has shaped methods and data across modern genomics. One goal behind the original sequencing of the human genome was to provide a reference for future analysis and this has been wildly successful. The current reference genome works primarily as the backbone for all genomic data and databases. It provides a scaffold for genome assembly, variant calling, -seq alignment, gene annotation and functional analysis. These successes make the reference genome an essential resource in many research efforts. However, a few problems do exist:
1) The reference genome is idiosyncratic.  
2) The reference genome is frequently confused with a healthy baseline.  
3) The reference genome is hard to re-evaluate. 

We suggest that switching to a consensus reference offers important advantages over the current reference with few disadvantages. 
A consensus genome represents the most common alleles and variants of a population. A consensus genome is comparatively painless to existing research practice, looking substantially like a new reference in the current mode, but reflecting real improvements in interpretation and generalizability to new uses. In its very nature a consensus genome addresses the three concerns we have with the current reference: it is easy to replicate and is accessible, it is empirical and thus a baseline and is easily open to novel evaluation and adjustment to suit different baselines (e.g., populations).
